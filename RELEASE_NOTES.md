## What's New

### 🚀 True Native Desktop App
- **No More Server**: SERVE is now a standalone Windows application. No background terminal windows, no Node.js server process. Just the app.
- **Instant Launch**: Starts immediately and runs efficiently as a native process.
- **Local-First**: Your database (`serve.db`) is embedded and managed locally for maximum privacy and speed.

### ✨ Enhanced Experience
- **Custom Window Controls**: A sleek, dark-themed title bar that blends perfectly with the minimalist aesthetic.
- **Static Architecture**: Rebuilt from the ground up using Next.js Static Export + Rust (Tauri v2).
- **Secure**: All authentication happens directly on your device via GitHub Device Flow.
